Text Summarization Quality Control - Use Case 8

This example demonstrates how to use Guardrails to ensure text summaries maintain
semantic similarity to original documents using embedding-based validation.

Key Features:
- Install SimilarToDocument validator (simulated)
- Define similarity threshold for validation
- Generate summaries that maintain content fidelity
- Filter low-quality summaries
